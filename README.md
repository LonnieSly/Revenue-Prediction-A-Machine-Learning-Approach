Revenue Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

![Project Banner](Screenshot (18).png)

This project demonstrates the critical role of feature selection in building accurate machine learning models. Starting with a simple single-variable regression, this analysis evolves into a more robust multi-variable model to predict e-commerce revenue. The results clearly show that a well-chosen set of features is paramount for high-quality predictions.
This repository documents the entire process, from initial analysis to final model evaluation, serving as a practical case study in data journalism and applied machine learning.

üìà Project Overview (The STAR Method)
The STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method provides a clear narrative of the project's lifecycle.

Situation: The initial goal was to predict sales revenue using a single feature: the quantity of items sold. The first model, a single-variable linear regression, yielded an R¬≤ score of 0.59. This indicated that 'Quantity' alone was only a moderate predictor of 'Revenue', leaving a significant portion of the variance unexplained.
Task: The primary objective was to drastically improve the model's predictive accuracy. This required identifying and incorporating additional features that could capture more of the underlying patterns in the revenue data.

Action:
Baseline Model: A single-variable linear regression was built in Python using scikit-learn, with 'Quantity' as the feature and 'Revenue' as the target.
Enhanced Model: A multi-variable linear regression model was then developed, adding 'Price' (per item) as a second feature.
Rigorous Evaluation: Both models were evaluated using the R¬≤ Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantitatively measure the improvement in performance.
Data Visualization: Key visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn to effectively communicate the results. These include a 2D scatter plot of actual vs. predicted revenue, a residual distribution plot, and an interactive 3D plot showing the relationship between Quantity, Price, and Revenue.

Result: Adding the 'Price' feature led to a dramatic enhancement in the model's performance. The R¬≤ score jumped from 0.59 to 0.93, and the MSE fell sharply from 92.20 to 16.60. This outcome powerfully demonstrates that a more comprehensive feature set leads to a significantly more accurate and reliable predictive model.

üéØ Problem and Solution
This project directly addresses a common challenge in data analysis: building models that are both simple and effective.
The Problem
The initial single-variable model was too simplistic. An R¬≤ score of 0.59 meant that 41% of the variance in revenue could not be explained by the quantity of items sold. For any practical business forecasting, this level of uncertainty is unacceptable and could lead to poor decision-making.

The Solution
The solution was to engineer a more sophisticated model by incorporating a highly influential variable: the price per item. By creating a multi-variable linear regression model, we built a far more reliable tool for predicting revenue. The final model, with its R¬≤ score of 0.93, can explain 93% of the revenue's variance, making it a robust and insightful tool. The significant drop in MSE further validates its enhanced precision.

üí° Key Learnings & Insights
Feature Selection is King: This project is a clear testament to the importance of feature engineering. The inclusion of 'Price' transformed the model from a rough estimator into a highly accurate predictor.
Metrics-Driven Evaluation: Using R¬≤ and MSE provides a standardized and objective way to assess model performance. These metrics were crucial for quantifying the value added by the new feature.
Visualization as a Storytelling Tool: The visualizations are not just charts; they are the narrative backbone of the analysis. They make the performance difference between the models immediately apparent and help stakeholders understand the relationships within the data.

üìä Visualizations Included
The Jupyter Notebook contains several key visualizations:
Actual vs. Predicted Revenue: A 2D scatter plot that visually confirms the high accuracy of the multi-variable model.
Residual Distribution Plot: A histogram showing that the model's errors are normally distributed, which is a sign of a well-behaved regression model.
3D Plot of Quantity, Price, and Revenue: An interactive 3D plot that visualizes the plane of best fit and illustrates how revenue changes with both quantity and price.
